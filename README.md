# JavaScript Quote Generator

![Quote Generator](/images/screenshot.png)

This was one of the projects I built working towards my JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification with FreeCodeCamp.

The project was built using, HTML, CSS and jQuery. 

As the project was built a couple of years ago, it needs a little bit of love.

### Future Improvements

1. Refactor code 
2. Use vanilla JavaScript instead of jQuery
3. Use API to poulate the quotes
4. Fix twitter funcionality
