# JavaScript Quote Generator

![Quote Generator](/images/screenshot.png)

This was one of the projects I built working towards my JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification with FreeCodeCamp.

The project was built using, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The button will generate a new Quote, fetched from https://type.fit/api/quotes api.
